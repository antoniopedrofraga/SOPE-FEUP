# Operating Systems

The main objectives of this curricular unit were to provide the fundamental knowledge on:
* the structure and the functioning of an operating system;
* the use of the Application Programming Interface (API) of a real.

The programming language used to develop these projects was [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
